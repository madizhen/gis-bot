# gis-bot
Annoying, yet quaint little bot that follows, shares (retweets) &amp; likes :globe_with_meridians:GIS:globe_with_meridians: things.

This bot runs off of Node.js, [Twitter NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/twitter "Twitter npm") & [Twitter API](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/api-reference-index "Twitter api").

To run this boy in the command line, type in `node gisbot.js`

Unfortuantely, I'm not going to give out this bot's Twitter creditials, so you'll have to use your own bot. Which can be made [here](https://apps.twitter.com/app/new "click to adopt a bot!"):hatching_chick:. I'll write more in this later about the steps to creating a bot. Until then!

(But please note that I'm still having some trouble with the retweet function. (To be fixed shortly.))
